Coming soon...

We will showcase a use case end-to-end, including task pipeline, configuration, logging and tracing, evaluation, and optimization.

.. Will use end to end trec classifier as an example to demonstrate:

.. 1. Look at the data and task, create `data class`, `prompt`, and `task`, and set up `log` and tracing.
.. 2. Create datasets with `train`, `eval`, and `test` splits.
.. 3. Eval zero-shot with manual prompts.


.. The content will be from `/use_cases/classification/readme.md`.
