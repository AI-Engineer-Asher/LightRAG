Contributing
=============================
Welcome to the AdalFlow community! We're building the most user-friendly, modular library for building and auto-optimizing LLM applications, from Chatbots, RAGs, to Agents.
Think of AdalFlow to LLM applications and in-context learning is like PyTorch/TensorFlow/JAX for AI modeling.
The goal is to provide basic and foudamental building blocks to build advanced applications with auto-optimization out-of-the-box.
As we mature, we might see more RAG, memory-based chatbots, or agents frameworks will be built on top of AdalFlow building blocks such as retriever, generator.

We highly suggest you to read our :ref:`design principle<lightrag_design_philosophy>` before you start contributing.

We only accept high quality contribution.
We appreciate contributors but we have to hold our libary responsible for users.
Once you decide to contribute, we hope you are not just to list your name on the repo, but more importantly, you learn and improve your own skills! you support your faviroty projects and community!

It took us 3 months to setup a contributing guide, as we did explore with users and think a lot on how to organize labels and what is the best process that can control the quality of our library while leveraing the open-source community. **We will continously improve our process and we welcome any suggestion and advice.**
We are determined to make AdalFlow as great and legendary as PyTorch.

The contributing guide includes three parts:

* Overall Contribution Process (include env and structure)
* Code and testing
* Documentation Contribution
