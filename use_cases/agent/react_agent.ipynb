The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Mustafa III to serve as his imperial or sultanic mosque.[2][3] Although it was tradition among earlier sultans to build their imperial mosque in commemoration of a major military success, Mustafa III ignored this tradition by ordering the construction before any such victories.[3] Construction began on 5 April 1760 and was completed on 9 March 1764.[4][3] According to a contemporary writer, the mosque was officially named Nur Mustafa ('Light of Mustafa'), but it became popularly known as the Laleli Mosque ('Mosque of the Tulips') after the name of the neighbourhood where it was built.[3]. The architect of the mosque is not confirmed by historical documentation, but art historians have attributed the mosque to Mehmed Tahir Agha, the chief imperial architect at the time of the mosque's completion.[a][2][4][5] On average, about 770 workers were employed in the project and about two thirds of them were non-Muslims, the rest being Muslim.[5].
