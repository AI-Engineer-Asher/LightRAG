This is to show how LightRAG is used to optimize a task end to end, from the using of datasets, the configuration,s the setting up of evalutor, the training pipeline on top of the `task pipeline ("Model")` itself.

## Task pipeline(Model)
## Optimizing it with ICL
## Optimizing it with model finetuning using TorchTune
