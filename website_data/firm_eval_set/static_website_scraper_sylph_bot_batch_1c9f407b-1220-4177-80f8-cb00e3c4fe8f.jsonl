Yet, if we look at where most innovation and venture funding has gone in the past 40 years, it is towards creating and improving our digital lives. Very little of our material and industrial society has changed, and humankind has never been more out of touch with the material world than now. More than 80% of humanity lives in cities, where jobs in the service industry dominate greatly. Few city dwellers are exposed to the reality of how our material world comes about \u2014 from food to machines, devices, energy and materials. For instance, in the US less than 1% of the population is engaged in producing food and it is safe to assume that a good percentage of the population knows very little about the many steps between a cow on a farm and the steak on their tables \u2014 or a lithium mine in Chile and their Tesla.", "a_15": {"href": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p-lDYPR2P8&ab_channel=Madonna", "text": "we are living in a material world"}, "img_2": {"src": "https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:962/1*oUQx2v2Hl61eytACadplJg.png"}, "p_3": "If we were to travel back to the 1960s, the cars we would be travelling in, the textiles we would be wearing, the food we would be eating, the packaging we would be using and the sources of energy we would be leveraging would not be\u00a0that\u00a0dramatically different from what we are using today. If our 1960s counterparts were to travel back a century to the 1860s well \u2026 the physical world around them would look incredibly different. The society we live in right now and the progress we have achieved are ultimately a result of the petrochemical evolution and the internal combustion engine \u2014 as Carlota Perez calls it, the Age of Automobile. But innovation in the material world has stalled after that. So far.", "p_4": "Enter Synthetic Biology (SynBio) and the BioRevolution.\u00a0We are on the brink of one of the most exciting production and supply chain revolutions of the century, with similar disruption potential to the Industrial Revolution in Britain in the 19th century.\u00a0Thanks to massive strides in computing, lab automation, AI and ML, computation as well as molecular and genetic engineering, up to 60% of the physical inputs in the global economy today could be produced or substituted using biology. That means food, fuels, materials, heavy industries, chemicals, and energy \u2014 to begin with.\u00a0The BioRevolution offers a paradigm shift in how means of production are allocated and distributed. SynBio allows society to move away from using centralised, huge, polluting factories as primary production facilities, towards a world where primary goods are produced locally, efficiently, sustainably and through waste or organic feedstocks. Cells can enable us to produce whatever we want, wherever and whenever we need, potentially transforming manufacturing and supply chains as we know them.

Do the millions of workers who depend on the chemical industry in Switzerland want to be trained to operate bioreactor-filled plants? Are there skills that can be applied across traditional farming and lab-grown meat cultivating? Who will fund the millions of large-scale bioreactors and are steel and sugar going to become prime commodities of the next century? Will the outskirts of cities be turned into greenhouses, where billions of plants grow our protein intake, and so will \u2018Greenhouse Operator\u2019 be one of the new required job skills? Will we achieve truly distributed production or are we going to see another hegemony of developing countries? Pro-globalisation sentiments have been retracting for a while, but are our economies ready to stop relying on cheap manufacturing imported from Asia and what will China\u2019s role be in this new world order? What will be the impact on countries such as Vietnam or Malaysia that are currently relying on manufacturing exports for a significant portion of their GDP?

If this technology revolution follows its predecessors, the early-adoption phase will swiftly be followed by a recession period of instability, social unrest and populism before the true golden age where business and society both win. Managing the period of instability is the key challenge to ensure the success of the BioRevolution.\u00a0I argue that it is imperative that the BioEconomy leaves the scientific and early-adopters community and we find a way to communicate the positive potential of this technological revolution in the most inclusive and equal way for everyone.\u00a0The BioRevolution should not leave anyone behind.", "p_9": "Every industrial revolution is, at first, a technological innovation \u2014 when something is possible technologically and brings socio-economic benefits, it is only a matter of time before it permeates society.

Often, the meeting of disruptive technology and societal implications can be a challenge, but also an opportunity.\u00a0The disruptors in this sector have the responsibility and opportunity to shape the narrative of this new era for the wider society, yet this is one of the biggest SynBio challenges that doesn\u2019t get discussed enough.\u00a0The impact of BioManufacturing on society is too positively transformational to undermine the challenge of shaping the right narrative for this revolution. So, how do we educate the new generation of BioConsumers? How do we ensure that consumers start interacting positively with SynBio products as soon as possible?

Because surety bonds are usually reserved for large-scale transactions and contracts, that means their underwriting is lengthy and expensive.

Customers buy MicroBonds to assure credit teams that they will fulfill the terms of a contract.", "p_6": "Without MicroBonds, credit teams have several options to mitigate risk. For example, they can decide not to extend credit and ask customers to pay upfront in cash, but that means both sides have less liquidity to grow their businesses. Credit teams can ask for collateral-based security, including bank guarantees, but those take about three to six months to enact, and also leave customers with limited liquidity. Another option is credit insurance; the drawback there is that those policies can be cancelled by insurers. Underwritten by S&P A+ insurers, MicroBonds seek to solve all those problems by giving credit teams and their customers a faster, non-cancellable alternative that is available online.", "p_7": "When TechCrunch first covered Bondaval, it was focused on independent retailers and the supply chain. Small retailers can still benefit from MicroBonds because they only need to pay an annual premium instead of posting collateral-based security, which means more liquidity. But Bondaval has expanded into new use cases for credit managers at large companies, which need to secure payments on a portfolio basis.

We look to invest in companies that not only drive potential financial returns but also benefit the society that we live in.\nVenture capital firms play a pivotal role in funding the companies seeking to make real change in society.

Needless to say, these are still important: we wouldn\u2019t have the funding to back the companies of the future without these returns. But why shouldn\u2019t we discuss D&I policies in board meetings in the same way that we talk about retention metrics? There needs to be a shift in mentality that ESG isn\u2019t secondary to profit, but it works in tandem with it: the reality today is that returns to society and financial returns need not be mutually exclusive. While we back some companies where areas of ESG are absolutely intrinsic to their mission, good ESG practices can, and should be, integrated across every single business. And let\u2019s be honest \u2013 it\u2019s much easier to build a company from the ground up with ESG in mind, rather than integrating it later as an afterthought.", "p_4": "There\u2019s a lot of greenwashing around ESG in the industry at the moment, but ESG is not a tickbox exercise for Talis.

What we want to do is provide the foundations for an open conversation of where companies are at now, where they want to be in the coming years \u2013 and crucially, how we can help them get there.

This is a standardised Q&A which covers essential questions relating to our Six Pillars framework, which includes environmental impact & climate change; sustainable supply chains; diversity & inclusion; employee safety; health and wellbeing; strong governance & ethical business standards, and responsible product design & data. Our investment team identifies areas where greater ESG due diligence is needed and presents this to the fund\u2019s Investment Committee. When ESG risks are too great and cannot be rectified in a reasonable timeframe, no investment is made.", "p_11": "Once our IC has approved and the term sheet has been accepted, we undergo a much more intensive ESG due diligence process.
