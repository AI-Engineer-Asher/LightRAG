We believe that founders, regardless of where they are from, regardless of their physical attributes, regardless of their technical acumen can build really great companies given the right access to tools, resources, guidance, support and network. After enduring everything from 3 AM calls to rescue funding deals that were on the brink of collapse, to the states of emergency that arise when a system halting technical failure rears it's head prior to a big pitch, to companies who have raised millions from prominent VC firms and fear telling their investors they are clueless about how to move their business forward; we have over the years strapped on our capes, rolled up our sleeves and helped countless startups thrive.", "p_13": "This help has resulted in exits, glass ceiling breakthrough investments and shifting of entire industries. But much like Olivia Pope and the Gladiators, we as a team have done this and more with no fanfare and no glory. We do not place a lot of emphasis on marketing ourselves, we save that for our startups. Many of our peers are perplexed as to why we would expend our own money, our own time, our own talents, and our own resources to help startups win. What we do is quite unconventional for most investment models. For us the answer is simple. We have been founders, who have raised capital and wished for the type of judgement free, discreet, specialized, safe shelter of support and guidance we provide to our founders.", "p_14": "Nearly 99% of founders we engage all share one common characteristic; they want to obtain investment. Of the 99%, less than 5% are really even ready to approach the topic. We have a set of proverbs at 42Phi that we emboss into our startups. We always start with the first, the holy grail, the genesis of every other proverb,", "p_15": "“Those who raise customers, raise money”.", "p_16": "This truth is inescapable. Sure, there are exceptions, but the law of process says “never manage to the exception, but rather manage to the rule.“", "p_17": "Our mission is to help early stage startups fortify foundational structure, team building, product placement, technology, user adoption, revenue strategy, branding, and more, in order to maximize their ability to raise funds. We are not content to watch founders flail and innovation die for lack of access to needed resources and guidance.", "p_18": "And once startups do raise capital and their coffers are filled with cash, we become the air traffic controller to keep them on the runway.  We make a long term commitment to work with each startup selected. Because of our practice of discretion, we are able to dive very deep into their business; how they are executing the model, the interaction of the team, and hands on viability and validation of the technology. Startups come to us at every stage from ideation to Pre-series A and we meet them where they are.", "p_19": "We are often asked, “are we competing with other Investors?”", "p_20": "Our answer: “No”. We provide value to investors as the day to day caretakers to help reduce the risk of investing in early stage companies and ensure that their investments grow healthy and strong.", "p_21": "We are subsequently asked, “are we competing with Incubators?”", "p_22": "Our answer: “No”. Most incubators are regional and are limited to a fixed time. Similar to the value we add to Investor, we become the day to day caretakers of the investment. We also help to guide startups beyond their regional experience on a more agnostic path towards Silicon Valley investment.", "p_23": "Lastly we are asked, “who are we competing with?”", "p_24": "Our answer: “Ourselves”. We challenge ourselves daily to ensure that startups, regardless of where they are from, regardless of their physical attributes, regardless of their technical acumen have equal opportunity for success.", "p_25": "After 12,000 startup interactions, 250 investment firms and 100 incubators, we knew the true importance of our work.

This city has been the catalyst in creating world-changing technology, but it has failed to bridge the chasm in opportunity and wealth creation for people of color. As a part of Start Up, Stay Up, Scale Up (SU3), 42Phi Ventures began deciphering the root cause of exclusion in high-growth entrepreneurship, inaccessible funding, and lack of wealth creation opportunities. Though many initiatives are attempting to connect venture funds to more entrepreneurs of color, our work with SU3 focuses on the systemic roots that have allowed these inequalities to metastasize.", "p_16": "As the lead of the San Francisco SU3 initiative, we have identified four avenues to address broad inequalities: 1) de-risking entrepreneurship, 2) changing the narratives that surround founders of color, 3) increasing  participation of people of color in crowd-funding and micro-investing, and 4) boosting the procurement dollars that the largest companies in the San Francisco Bay Area are spending with companies led by entrepreneurs of color. First, though, it’s important to understand how the city came to be so racially inequitable.", "p_17": "Wealth Gap: Diverse, Not Inclusive", "p_18": "In the early 1900s, tens of thousands flocked west to San Francisco in hopes of striking gold. This prospecting culture and the ability to create great wealth is the core tenant that draws people to the Bay Area today. San Francisco is known for its richness in landscape, culture, opportunity and extreme wealth. It has been the home of dreams for the Ohlone Natives, Spanish monks, gold miners and now -- tech billionaires. It is a place that has been fertile ground for wealth and cultural diversity for 300 years. Over the past three decades, the Bay Area has experienced an explosion of wealth greater than that of the California Gold Rush and more concentrated than any place in the world at any point in history.", "p_19": "However, San Francisco--in all of its rich culture and diversity--has a long history of racial exclusion. After World War II came the vibrant growth of the city’s African-American population and the birth of the famous Fillmore District. Black people flocked from the Midwest and South in search of better job opportunities. Between the 1940 and 1950 census, San Francisco’s Black population grew from approximately 4,000 to 42,000 people. Black entrepreneurship flourished, surrounded by an explosion of arts, music, literature and politics alongside the sounds of jazz and blues. The Fillmore soon became known as the “Harlem of the West”. After nearly a decade of vibrancy, the the California Redevelopment Act of 1945 extinguished the flame of progress  by giving the city eminent domain to displace real property and businesses owned by the Fillmore’s mostly African-American residents.", "p_20": "Latinos Have Been Left Out, Too", "p_21": "Despite the region’s racial diversity (White Americans 48.5%, Asians 33.3%, Hispanics 15.1%, African Americans 6.1%, Native Americans 0.5%), not everyone has enjoyed the benefits of the area’s great wealth.[9] Population changes among people of color have only lead to growing disparities in wealth. Between 1970 and 2018, the Bay Area’s Black population dwindled from 13.5% to 5.4%. At the very epicenter of innovation, San Francisco has fewer Black residents than any other major city in the US.", "p_22": "Meanwhile, the Latino population in San Francisco has nearly doubled.[6] Yet, the shift out of the Mission has rapidly increased. Newcomers, like technology companies and their employees, have been drawn to the vibrant culture of the Mission, which has resulted in Gentrification and displacement of working-class Latino families. Many can no longer afford the rising housing prices in their neighborhood. As a result, the Mission shed nearly 22% of its Latino population between 2000 to 2010. [13]", "p_23": "Though technology has brought great wealth to many formerly working-class neighborhoods in San Francisco, the wealth created has driven more inequality for Black and Latino people in the City by the Bay. Less than 2% of the $425 Billion in venture funding invested each year is invested in Black and Latino founders.[14]", "p_24": "Wealth Creation for Some", "p_25": "Technology is California’s new Gold Rush. Each year, approximately 10,000 people move to San Francisco in hopes of finding its wealth.[3] According to CB Insights, 49% of startups with a market cap of $1 billion dollars or greater are US companies, of which 85% are located in the San Francisco Bay Area. [4] [5] The first one hundred employees at these high-growth startups are all but guaranteed to become millionaires at an IPO event. Whether it’s becoming the next tech entrepreneur turned millionaire (maybe billionaire)--or finding millions as an early employee at a rocket ship startup destined for IPO--the fast track to wealth is the dream of many who migrate here.", "p_26": "But fewer and fewer Black people each year, by sheer geography, are within proximity to the wealth opportunities that high-growth companies are creating. Of the Black population that remains in San Francisco neighborhoods like Bayview, Hunter’s Point, and the Fillmore, very few can gain funding to build their own high-growth companies or will be hired as early employees at those companies.", "p_27": "As of 2018, less than 1.8% of all employees at Twitter, Facebook and Google were Black.[11] These abysmal numbers have sparked a demand for action by social groups, government officials and activists within organizations. As abysmal as these numbers were in 2018, at the earliest stages -- the first 100 employees -- Black professionals were nearly nonexistent.", "p_28": "The same is true for Latinos in the Bay Area. Although the Latino population has experienced growth, very little improvement has happened as a result of employment in high-growth tech. Hispanics comprise 22% of the non-tech working population in San Francisco, but have less than 6% representation in tech.[10]  Many large employers in the tech sector have seen a plateau in the number of Hispanic employees inside their organizations, with some companies also posting declines in leadership positions from 2017 to 2018. [7][8][9]", "p_29": "The failure of high-growth companies to employ people of color, and the hurdles those people of color encounter when they seek venture investment, all but guarantee exclusion from future wealth creation and spur a widening gap along racial lines.", "p_30": "SU3 San Francisco Initiatives", "p_31": "We believe our work with the Start Up, Stay Up, Scale Up (SU3) in San Francisco will lay the groundwork for bridging the divide in the wealth gap.
