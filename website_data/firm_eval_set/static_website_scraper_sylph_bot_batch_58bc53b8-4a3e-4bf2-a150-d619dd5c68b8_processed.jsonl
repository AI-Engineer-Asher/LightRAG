Since our launch, we’ve seen incredible demand for our product; the outpouring of positive feedback from ByHeart customers strengthened our conviction to double down on our supply chain in order to provide families with safe and reliable nourishment for their babies,” says ByHeart CEO and Co-Founder Ron Belldegrun. “When we started ByHeart seven years ago, we committed to taking the longer path and building from the ground up to serve as an example for how this industry can and should evolve. By acquiring these additional facilities, we are not only providing critical product to more families, but also further strengthening the vulnerable infant formula supply chain in this country.”", "p_7": "“Infant formula is one of the most value added dairy products in the world. We at Dairy Farmers of America are committed to producing high-quality milk and dairy ingredients in a sustainable way while building relationships that leverage the value of dairy nutrition for infant formula,” says Martin Bates, president of DFA Ingredient Solutions. “We look forward to continuing to work with ByHeart, which we believe has the potential to unlock significant opportunity for our 11,500 family farmers across the country.”", "p_8": "ByHeart’s acquisition of an additional production facility dedicated to infant formula will yield a crucial incremental supply of infant formula in the US and ultimately contribute to safeguarding the country from future shortages. As the only infant formula newcomer able to use its clinical trials and manufacturing expertise to enhance the capabilities of existing facilities in the US, ByHeart is continuing to advance 21st-century nutrition to ensure access to a higher quality formula for more families.", "p_9": "When Belldegrun and Funt founded ByHeart in 2016, they set out to develop an infant formula that incorporated the advancements in modern nutrition science and breast milk research that had previously outpaced product innovation in this space. Building the company from scratch allowed ByHeart to personally source each ingredient, acquire their manufacturing and R&D, and apply rigorous quality standards to every touchpoint in the production process. This revolutionary approach yielded the first clinically proven, easy-to-digest infant formula with no corn syrup, maltodextrin, soy, or palm oil. ByHeart’s patented protein blend gets closest to breast milk to drive “all in one” functional benefits for a baby. Results from ByHeart’s breakthrough national clinical study have been published in the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. Investing in end-to-end US manufacturing and owning three domestic facilities should allow ByHeart to provide formula to more families and strengthen the supply of this vital first food.", "p_10": "About ByHeart", "p_11": "Founded in 2016 and based in New York City with manufacturing facilities across three states, ByHeart is a next-generation baby nutrition company dedicated to empowering parents with choices for a better feeding future. ByHeart is the first new infant formula manufacturer to be registered with the FDA in over 15 years, and its next-generation, easy-to-digest infant formula is defined by nutritional excellence and a farm-to-formula verified™ quality program.

TORL’s pipeline of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were discovered in the laboratory of scientific co-founder Dennis Slamon, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine, and Chief of the Division of Hematology/Oncology at UCLA’s David Geffen School of Medicine (DGSOM). He is an accomplished physician and scientist whose research was pivotal in identifying HER2 as a target in breast cancer and the development and initial approval of trastuzumab (Herceptin). Dr. Slamon’s lab went on to discover CDK4/6 as an important target in hormone receptor (HR+) positive breast cancer. Subsequently, his group led the clinical development of CDK4/6 inhibitors, resulting in breakthrough status therapies palbociclib (Ibrance) and ribociclib (Kisqali), in HR+ breast cancer.", "p_2": "TORL is built on a strategic partnership with the Slamon Research Lab at UCLA, whereby the Company has exclusive development and commercial rights to biologics-based drug candidates focused on promising cancer targets. TORL’s lead drug programs target Claudin 6 (CLDN 6) and Claudin 18.2 (CLDN 18.2), both of which are currently in clinical trials. The Company also expects to put 2-3 additional compounds into clinical trials over the next 12 months, with plans to advance 1-2 new compounds each year.", "p_3": "“It has been very rewarding to use 30 years of experience, lessons learned, and preclinical models developed in our lab for this new company for,” said Dennis Slamon, M.D., Ph.D., Co-Founder of TORL. “This unique academic/corporate partnership allows us to quickly identify novel targets, validate them preclinically, then proceed to bring these new biologic treatments into clinical testing and development in an exceptionally rapid and efficient manner. Our goal is to develop compounds that address critical or as yet unmet medical needs while simultaneously providing new and effective treatment options for cancer patients that can be life and practice changing. There are more of these to come, and we are thrilled we have this partnership to expand cancer therapy.”", "p_4": "Leveraging the Slamon research lab’s unique discovery engine and validation platforms, TORL was founded to promote its novel oncology biologics with industry leading speed and capital efficiency. Since its inception in 2018, TORL has moved forward three, internally developed drug programs into the clinic and advanced two more through IND-enabling studies with less than $50 million.", "p_5": "“It has been tremendously gratifying to pioneer TORL’s innovative approach to drug discovery and development, culminating in the launch of multiple clinical trials with our drugs over the past year”, said David Licata, TORL’s CEO. “We created and demonstrated an original, capital efficient structure which, despite the challenging market conditions, attracted a distinguished group of biotech investors with a shared vision for rapid cancer drug development. With the close of this Series B financing, we can advance our new programs into the clinic and existing clinical-stage programs into the next phase.”", "p_6": "“Despite meaningful advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, most patients worldwide continue to face serious morbidity and significant mortality,” said Mark Alles, TORL’s Executive Chairman. “With strong support from our highly accomplished investors, we are building a preeminent biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of first and best-in-class antibody-based immunotherapies to improve and extend the lives of people living with this terrible disease.”", "p_7": "“TORL represents a unique model for company formation. Through their holistic relationship with the Slamon research lab and UCLA, the Company can leverage decades of scientific expertise and deep research capabilities while avoiding the significant costs and risks associated with early-stage discovery,” said Amit Sinha, Head of Life Sciences Investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “We believe TORL-1-23 and TORL-2-307 represent promising potential therapies for ovarian and gastric cancers, two indications with significant unmet patient need. We look forward to partnering with the TORL team to rapidly advance the lead programs toward late-stage clinical trials while progressing the broader portfolio of novel programs.”", "p_8": "TORL builds on a 30-year history of scientific collaboration amongst a team of clinical pioneers and laboratory researchers.
