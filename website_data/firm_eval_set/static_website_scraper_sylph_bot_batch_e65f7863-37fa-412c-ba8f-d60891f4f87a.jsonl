Moreover, an increasing number of D&I supporters are pointing out that\u00a0the traditional approaches to corporate D&I have failed to demonstrate significant progress\u00a0\u2013 a particularly troubling observation given the billions of dollars poured annually into D&I initiatives,\u00a0with little progress to show in the past several decades.", "a_35": {"href": "https://hbr.org/2020/11/getting-serious-about-diversity-enough-already-with-the-business-case", "text": "the traditional approaches to corporate D&I have failed to demonstrate significant progress"}, "a_36": {"href": "https://www.boldtypebooks.com/titles/pamela-newkirk/diversity-inc/9781568588223/", "text": "with little progress to show in the past several decades"}, "p_2": "While many corporations wax poetic about the value of D&I, there is often an unstated belief that the primary benefits of corporate D&I are reputation management and risk management.

For some companies, the civil unrest had an immediate impact in terms of stores being shut down and in some cases vandalized during protests. Other industries have been dramatically impacted by\u00a0the preponderance of Black and brown people among essential workers, which, coupled with the disproportionate health impact of Covid -19, has led to shutdowns and other disruptive events.", "a_37": {"href": "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html", "text": "the preponderance of Black and brown people among essential workers"}, "p_5": "The combination of these tumultuous events has made it clear that our society is a complex, highly interconnected ecosystem, and that corporate risk management needs to widen its lens to consider the role of each corporation within a much broader societal context: rather than simply focusing on diversity in terms of representation of their workforce or their suppliers, corporations should realize that investing in making all of society more inclusive and equitable is of paramount importance \u2013 if not because of the value that it can create for the company, at least because of the risk that it can mitigate. Specifically, these recent events make it clear that our economy faces enormous risk from the civil unrest fueled by our country\u2019s growing income inequality and troubled race relations. Ignoring these sources of risk could and should be seen as a violation of a corporation\u2019s fiduciary obligation to its stakeholders.", "p_6": "These compelling ideas were shared with me by William Crowder and Garnet Heraman, two veterans of the Venture Capital (VC) and Impact Investing world, who recently founded\u00a0Aperture Venture Capital, which they describe as the \u201cdiversity investing API for the world\u2019s leading corporations.\u201d In a nutshell, Aperture is a new seed-stage venture fund that brings together corporations, mission-driven investors and founders from diverse backgrounds to reshape the startup landscape in a way that traditional VC firms have been unable to do. Crowder and Heraman created Aperture in response to the stunning lack of diversity in VC and tech in general, which leads to\u00a0the vast majority of VC funds going to white, male startup founders.", "a_38": {"href": "https://aperturevc.com/", "text": "Aperture Venture Capital"}, "a_39": {"href": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/venture-capitalists-still-give-most-of-their-money-to-white-men-study-finds-2019-02-13", "text": "the vast majority of VC funds going to white, male startup founders"}, "p_7": "The Aperture fund promises to yield multiple benefits for corporations.

For example, leading accelerator\u00a0TechStars\u00a0has launched multiple corporate-backed accelerators in partnership with corporate giants such as Barclays, MetLife and Comcast NBCUniversal; in this model, the accelerator program is designed and managed by TechStars, while the corporations have some influence in the selection of startups and have priority access to them. In an alternative model, some corporations have launched their own accelerators, such as the\u00a0SAP.iO Foundries, SAP\u2019s global network of accelerators that work with promising startups whose products have the potential to integrate with SAP solutions; this approach gives the corporation greater flexibility in designing a program that matches its specific needs, but it requires that the corporation hire its own staff, design its own program, and find its own startups. An interesting, hybrid model is provided by UK-based\u00a0L Marks, which has essentially created a two-sided marketplace, helping corporations develop innovation programs and then looking for startups who could be a good match.", "a_41": {"href": "https://www.techstars.com/", "text": "TechStars"}, "a_42": {"href": "https://sap.io/foundries/", "text": "SAP.iO Foundries"}, "a_43": {"href": "https://lmarks.com/", "text": "L Marks"}, "p_11": "Aperture takes a new approach to corporate startup investment, one that is motivated by, and firmly grounded in, the value of startup diversity. By creating an ecosystem of corporations and founders \u2013 rather than a collection of stand-alone corporate accelerators \u2013 they create fertile ground for diverse startups to access valuable capital, resources and access to potential key clients, while the participating corporations are able to tap into a much wider network of diverse startups than they would be able to do on their own. Corporations retain some of the flexibility in how they may want to work with startups, in a way that best aligns with their objectives and that takes advantage of their unique strengths and resources. And the founders benefit from having access to a broad set of corporate resources.", "p_12": "While some corporations \u2013 most notably Morgan Stanley with its\u00a0Multicultural Innovation Lab\u00a0\u2013 have already realized the value of working with founders from underappreciated segments, a single corporation cannot offer the breadth of resources as a network of corporations, and it will have to conduct its own outreach to attract startups with diverse founding teams.", "a_44": {"href": "https://www.morganstanley.com/about-us/diversity/multicultural-innovation-lab", "text": "Multicultural Innovation Lab"}, "p_13": "In contrast, much of the strength of Aperture\u2019s model lies in Crowder\u2019s and Heraman\u2019s deep experience in working with founders from diverse backgrounds, and the networks they have built: in his VC roles at Comcast, Morgan Stanley and Dreamit Ventures, Crowder has been an early investor in more than 100 companies with diverse founders, including being part of one of the largest Series A rounds raised by a Black woman founder (Lisa Skeete Tatum, who raised $13 million for\u00a0Landit). Heraman is a serial entrepreneur, angel investor and impact investor focused on building highly scalable innovation ecosystems in underrepresented communities, including the creation of an opportunity-zone fund focused on a joint venture with Morehouse College in Atlanta. Between them, Crowder and Heraman have both the network and the credibility needed to tap into a segment of the entrepreneurial ecosystem that is largely invisible and inaccessible to traditional VC firms.", "a_45": {"href": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-skeete-tatum/", "text": "Lisa Skeete Tatum"}, "a_46": {"href": "https://landit.com/", "text": "Landit"}, "p_14": "Crowder, who had been disappointed by the lack of significant change since he first got into investing in 2011 when he joined DreamIt Ventures, was looking for an opportunity to level the playing field for founders from diverse backgrounds. When a mutual friend reconnected him with Heraman \u2013 whom he had met years earlier \u2013 they began to discuss the idea, and saw an opportunity to \u201cbring together corporations that want to support the mission, go into the market, invest in the startups and provide them with unique resources.\u201d", "p_15": "Right after they started pitching their idea, the pandemic hit and the economy tanked, and people thought their idea was crazy. But then \u201cthe murder of George Floyd happened, and since then there hasn\u2019t been anybody that has not wanted to talk to us,\u201d Crowder told me.", "p_16": "\u201cOur one-line unique value proposition is that we offer a way to transform existing corporate strategy into a diversity investing apparatus,\u201d Heraman said in a recent conversation. \u201cCorporations have no problem with the notion of helping [diversity and inclusion] via philanthropy. But Black, brown, female founders don\u2019t need charity, they need investments.\u201d", "p_17": "Heraman also underscored another benefit for corporate partners: \u201cAperture will play a role in unleashing diverse entrepreneurs already resident in a corporation or its legacy portfolio companies. This means that diverse employees who have an innovation and want to launch a startup of their own will have an organic path to engaging with a fund where the managers look like them, and understand the strategic market space. The overall effect is a powerful virtuous cycle that\u00a0supports the retention of both human and intellectual capital, while also expanding the pool of potential startups for the fund.\u201d", "p_18": "Aperture\u2019s approach is refreshing as much as it is powerful. At a time when some corporations have been accused of \u201cperformative\u201d D&I,\u00a0i.e., the practice of talking about their support of D&I without actually doing something tangible, Aperture
