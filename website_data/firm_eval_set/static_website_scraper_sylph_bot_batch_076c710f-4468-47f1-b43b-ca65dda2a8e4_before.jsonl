However, as I settle into my second coffee in an attempt to clear the inbox before a flight, I come across a Sifted Daily Newsletter from a few weeks ago and their lead piece on the Silence of the Rounds. Whilst I largely agree with the sentiment of the piece \u2013 VC\u2019s have been quiet for the last 12 months, non-traditional sources of capital are filling equity rounds and quiet internal rounds are in vogue right now \u2013 there is one comment that sticks which I want to address\u2026", "https://www.claret-capital.com/using-venture-debt-to-grow-inorganically/": "using venture debt", "a_12": "using venture debt", "p_2": "\u201cIt could also mean that founders will look to cut costs rather than raise more money at a lower valuation [\u2026], it\u2019s either that or look to venture debt \u2013 an expensive option given current business rates.\u201d", "p_3": "Sifted Daily 21/2/2024", "p_4": "\u2026the idea that venture debt is more expensive now (which in my view is only half true), and that this is driven by the current interest rates. So, to restore the honor of the poor-slighted venture debt provider (not all heroes wear capes), I will dive into this, and look at \u201ctrue\u201d venture debt versus other lenders and equity to understand the real cost of venture debt to a start-up in the down round economy.", "p_5": "Know-Your-Lender", "p_6": "For the purposes of this tome I will attempt to provide my brief definition of venture debt and a venture debt fund, versus other forms of lending. Whilst this is not exhaustive; I hope it will provide some light on the cost structure.", "p_7": "Venture debt traditionally provides secured term loans, with no \u2013 or low \u2013 covenants whilst charging an interest rate (typically low double digits) and warrant coverage, giving them the right to buy shares in the future at a defined price. In Europe today this market is served by a handful of funds (Claret Capital Partners being one of the leading independent managers in the space), and somewhat replicated by banks who dip their toe into the space.", "p_8": "There are also other debt providers that often get lumped within Venture Debt \u2013 these can be Revenue Based Lenders underwriting predictable revenue streams and charging a percentage of these streams, banks providing term loans but looking to drive other banking services through their platforms, or mid-market lenders that will charge similar interest rates but would introduce more restrictive covenants and typically wouldn\u2019t have warrants as part of their deals.", "p_9": "With that preamble in place, the point is that a borrower should know their lenders\u2019 sources of capital to understand the cost of capital for their debt. Funds (which make up most true European venture debt providers under the above definition), and those lenders that raised fixed, blind pools of capital from LPs typically have a fixed cost of capital (the hurdle rate). Therefore the assertion that central bank interest rates make the cost of venture debt more expensive misses the mark. The opposite is true of other sources of debt, (banks, mid-market, RBF lenders etc.) where they are investing capital provided by a bank or other institution, and are charging a premium over central bank rates for riskier investments, as their cost of capital has increased in line with the rate hikes over the last 24 months \u2013 going forward I will call these Alternative Lenders.", "p_10": "To put it simply, the return Alternative Lenders need to make to justify their access to capital has increased, and therefore so has the cost for the borrower. However, venture debt providers have maintained the same cost of capital throughout, despite the increase in interest rates.", "p_11": "So, the cost of venture debt hasn\u2019t changed?", "p_12": "In absolute terms no. We have seen some increase in interest rates over the last 24 months \u2013 this is largely driven by the market and risk (as there is less equity in the market underwriting future equity rounds, and in many cases the repayment of loans has become riskier).

Claret has deep relationships with LPs, VCs and entrepreneurs across the whole European ecosystem, and when joining I knew I could learn a lot from the whole team. It\u2019s also a very busy and interesting time in the venture market right now.", "p_6": "In recent years, the business landscape has seen significant disruption. What are the challenges faced by startup companies in their day-to-day operations and during their initial phases of business?", "p_7": "The current market presents lots of challenges for companies. Rising interest rates and difficulties in accessing capital have added to this. Consumer confidence has decreased, leading to changes in buying habits. Consequently, many companies are faced with the task of re-evaluating their strategies and shifting to more profitable growth whilst trying to remain competitive in this environment. Regrettably, not all companies will emerge successfully from these circumstances. Understanding cost structures and workforce requirements has been critical to this, and we have seen a lot of startups having to implement workforce reductions, which can impact company culture.", "p_8": "In this market, resilience and efficiency are essential for companies to navigate successfully. It is crucial to assess the present situation and align actions with the overall vision for the business. Tough decisions have already been made, and there may be more ahead.", "p_9": "The market is under pressure, and we remain actively engaged, completing three to four deals each month across various sectors and geographic regions, primarily in Europe and partly in Singapore. Our goal is to back the right companies that are doing something unique in their field.", "p_10": "Additionally, we are committed to supporting our 80 plus existing portfolio companies as they navigate through this challenging environment.", "p_11": "What specific factors should entrepreneurs consider when deciding on venture debt in the current market environment?", "p_12": "In this market its tougher and more expensive to raise capital, specifically equity. Venture debt usually supplements equity, especially if the company is still loss making.\u00a0 It is typically used to get you to the next equity round, or more often than not in this market, to get you to profitability. Also, a lot of our portfolio companies have used debt to fund acquisitions, and we are seeing a lot of these types of deals in this market.", "p_13": "Businesses are now much more efficient than they were a couple of years ago and that can make it a better credit from a lending perspective.", "p_14": "Our venture debt product is intended for supporting growth, not for ensuring survival. In the current market, we observe many companies experiencing stagnant or declining revenues quarter over quarter or year over year \u2013 for such businesses, seeking capital, especially in the form of venture debt, is not suitable.", "p_15": "How will technology impact venture debt?", "p_16": "There is significant potential for advancements in technology within the venture debt and venture capital world. One of the most prominent areas is the rise of AI. This technology could play a pivotal role in enhancing our efficiency in tasks like screening companies, conducting underwriting and due diligence processes, and streamlining legal procedures.", "p_17": "We are also interested in further developments in smart contracts and blockchain technology. Once these breakthroughs occur, they have the potential to significantly enhance the security aspects of lending, which is crucial in our line of work.", "p_18": "Moreover, adopting a data analytical approach and leveraging AI in our assessments of businesses will be important as we scale. However, ultimately, both venture capital and venture debt are people-oriented businesses. Understanding entrepreneurs\u2019 aspirations and objectives often goes beyond what data analysis can reveal. Therefore, we remain committed to maintaining a balanced focus, placing qualitative assessment alongside quantitative analysis in our industry practices.", "p_19": "Could you share some advice for those seeking a career in venture debt or venture capital?", "p_20": "Yes, venture debt and venture capital are interconnected industries, and my advice would be to focus on building a strong network. The venture capital world heavily relies on relationships, and your network is instrumental in generating deal flow. Starting early in your career to establish and nurture connections is crucial. The analysts and associates of today will become the partners of firms tomorrow, which emphasizes the significance of networking from an entry-level position.", "p_21": "For our firm, collaborating with venture capitalists is key to our business, as they often introduce us to potential investment opportunities. Regardless of your career stage, maintaining a genuine interest in the industry is essential. Never hesitate to express your thoughts and insights, as you might possess valuable knowledge about a specific sector or customer group that others might not be aware of.
