write essays i wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then and probably still are short stories my stories were awful they had hardly any plot just characters with strong feelings which i imagined made them deep the first programs i tried writing were on the ibm 1401 that our school district used for what was then called data processing this was in 9th grade so i was 13 or 14 the school districts 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school and my friend rich draves and i got permission to use it it was like a mini bond villains lair down there with all these alienlooking machines cpu disk drives printer card reader sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights the language we used was an early version of fortran you had to type programs on punch cards then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it the result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer i was puzzled by the 1401 i couldnt figure out what to do with it and in retrospect theres not much i could have done with it the only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards and i didnt have any data stored on punched cards the only other option was to do things that didnt rely on any input like calculate approximations of pi but i didnt know enough math to do anything interesting of that type so im not surprised i cant remember any programs i wrote because they cant have done much my clearest memory is of the moment i learned it was possible for programs not to terminate when one of mine didnt on a machine without timesharing this was a social as well as a technical error as the data center managers expression made clear with microcomputers everything changed now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you on a desk that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a stack of punch cards and then stopping 1 the first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself it was sold as a kit by heathkit i remember vividly how impressed and envious i felt watching him sitting in front of it typing programs right into the computer computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before i convinced my father to buy one a trs80 in about 1980 the gold standard then was the apple ii but a trs80 was good enough this was when i really started programming i wrote simple games a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book there was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text so hed write 2 pages at a time and then print them out but it was a lot better than a typewriter though i liked programming i didnt plan to study it in college in college i was going to study philosophy which sounded much more powerful it seemed to my naive high school self to be the study of the ultimate truths compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge what i discovered when i got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasnt much left for these supposed ultimate truths all that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored i couldnt have put this into words when i was 18 all i knew at the time was that i kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring so i decided to switch to ai ai was in the air in the mid 1980s but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it a novel by heinlein called the moon is a harsh mistress which featured an intelligent computer called mike and a pbs documentary that showed terry winograd using shrdlu i havent tried

is a harsh mistress so i dont know how well it has aged but when i read it i was drawn entirely into its world it seemed only a matter of time before wed have mike and when i saw winograd using shrdlu it seemed like that time would be a few years at most all you had to do was teach shrdlu more words there werent any classes in ai at cornell then not even graduate classes so i started trying to teach myself which meant learning lisp since in those days lisp was regarded as the language of ai the commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive and programmers ideas correspondingly so the default language at cornell was a pascallike language called pli and the situation was similar elsewhere learning lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before i started to have a sense of where the new limits were this was more like it this was what i had expected college to do it wasnt happening in a class like it was supposed to but that was ok for the next couple years i was on a roll i knew what i was going to do for my undergraduate thesis i reverseengineered shrdlu my god did i love working on that program it was a pleasing bit of code but what made it even more exciting was my belief hard to imagine now but not unique in 1985 that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence i had gotten into a program at cornell that didnt make you choose a major you could take whatever classes you liked and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree i of course chose artificial intelligence when i got the actual physical diploma i was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included which made them read as scarequotes at the time this bothered me but now it seems amusingly accurate for reasons i was about to discover i applied to 3 grad schools mit and yale which were renowned for ai at the time and harvard which id visited because rich draves went there and was also home to bill woods whod invented the type of parser i used in my shrdlu clone only harvard accepted me so that was where i went i dont remember the moment it happened or if there even was a specific moment but during the first year of grad school i realized that ai as practiced at the time was a hoax by which i mean the sort of ai in which a program thats told the dog is sitting on the chair translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows what these programs really showed was that theres a subset of natural language thats a formal language but a very proper subset it was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language it was not in fact simply a matter of teaching shrdlu more words that whole way of doing ai with explicit data structures representing concepts was not going to work its brokenness did as so often happens generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various bandaids', ' and was also

various bandaids that could be applied to it but it was never going to get us mike so i looked around to see what i could salvage from the wreckage of my plans and there was lisp i knew from experience that lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with ai even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time so i decided to focus on lisp in fact i decided to write a book about lisp hacking its scary to think how little i knew about lisp hacking when i started writing that book but theres nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it the book on lisp wasnt published till 1993 but i wrote much of it in grad school computer science is an uneasy alliance between two halves theory and systems the theory people prove things and the systems people build things i wanted to build things i had plenty of respect for theory indeed a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two halves but building things seemed so much more exciting the problem with systems work though was that it didnt last any program you wrote today no matter how good would be obsolete in a couple decades at best people might mention your software in footnotes but no one would actually use it and indeed it would seem very feeble work only people with a sense of the history of the field would even realize that in its time it had been good there were some surplus xerox dandelions floating around the computer lab at one point anyone who wanted one to play around with could have one i was briefly tempted but they were so slow by present standards what was the point no one else wanted one either so off they went that was what happened to systems work i wanted not just to build things but to build things that would last in this dissatisfied state i went in 1988 to visit rich draves at cmu where he was in grad school one day i went to visit the carnegie institute where id spent a lot of time as a kid while looking at a painting there i realized something that might seem obvious but was a big surprise to me there right on the wall was something you could make that would last paintings didnt become obsolete some of the best ones were hundreds of years old and moreover this was something you could make a living doing not as easily as you could by writing software of course but i thought if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply it had to be possible to make enough to survive and as an artist you could be truly independent you wouldnt have a boss or even need to get research funding i had always liked looking at paintings could i make them i had no idea id never imagined it was even possible i knew intellectually that people made art that it didnt just appear spontaneously but it was

art to put that verb before that noun seemed almost miraculous', ' at a painting there i realized something that might seem obvious but was a big surprise to me there right on the wall was something

profiles in life magazine the idea of actually being able to make art to put that verb before that noun seemed almost miraculous that fall i started taking art classes at harvard grad students could take classes in any department and my advisor tom cheatham was very easy going if he even knew about the strange classes i was taking he never said anything so now i was in a phd program in computer science yet planning to be an artist yet also genuinely in love with lisp hacking and working away at on lisp in other words like many a grad student i was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis i didnt see a way out of this situation i didnt want to drop out of grad school but how else was i going to get out i remember when my friend robert morris got kicked out of cornell for writing the internet worm of 1988 i was envious that hed found such a spectacular way to get out of grad school then one day in april 1990 a crack appeared in the wall i ran into professor cheatham and he asked if i was far enough along to graduate that june i didnt have a word of my dissertation written but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life i decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline reusing parts of on lisp where i could and i was able to respond with no perceptible delay yes i think so ill give you something to read in a few days i picked applications of continuations as the topic in retrospect i should have written about macros and embedded languages theres a whole world there thats barely been explored but all i wanted was to get out of grad school and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed just barely meanwhile i was applying to art schools i applied to two risd in the us and the accademia di belli arti in florence which because it was the oldest art school i imagined would be good risd accepted me and i never heard back from the accademia so off to providence i went id applied for the bfa program at risd which meant in effect that i had to go to college again this was not as strange as it sounds because i was only 25 and art schools are full of people of different ages risd counted me as a transfer sophomore and said i had to do the foundation that summer the foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing color and design toward the end of the summer i got a big surprise a letter from the accademia which had been delayed because theyd sent it to cambridge england instead of cambridge massachusetts inviting me to take the entrance exam in florence that fall this was now only weeks away my nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic i had some money saved from consulting work id done in grad school there

there were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying art in florence that the italian students would otherwise have been outnumbered i was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the risd foundation that summer but i still dont know how i managed to pass the written exam i remember that i answered the essay question by writing about cezanne and that i cranked up the intellectual level as high as i could to make the most of my limited vocabulary 2 im only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns here i was yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject and yet again about to be disappointed the students and faculty in the painting department at the accademia were the nicest people you could imagine but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldnt require the faculty to teach anything and in return the faculty wouldnt require the students to learn anything and at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier we actually had one of those little stoves fed with kindling that you see in 19th century studio paintings and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned except hardly anyone else painted her besides me the rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things theyd seen in american art magazines our model turned out to live just down the street from me she made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer shed copy an obscure old painting out of a book and then hed take the copy and maltreat it to make it look old 3 while i was a student at the accademia i started painting still lives in my bedroom at night these paintings were tiny because the room was and because i painted them on leftover scraps of canvas which was all i could afford at the time painting still lives is different from painting people because the subject as its name suggests cant move people cant sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time and when they do they dont sit very still so the traditional mo for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person which you then modify to match the specific person youre painting whereas a still life you can if you want copy pixel by pixel from what youre seeing you dont want to stop there of course or you get merely photographic accuracy and what makes a still life interesting is that its been through a head you want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you for example that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that its the edge of an object by subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense but in the strict informationtheoretic sense 4 i liked painting still lives because i was curious about what i was seeing in everyday life we arent consciously aware of much were seeing most visual perception is handled by lowlevel processes that merely tell your brain thats', ' move people cant sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time and

a water droplet without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are or thats a bush without telling you the shape and position of every leaf this is a feature of brains not a bug in everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush but when you have to paint something you have to look more closely and when you do theres a lot to see you can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted this is not the only way to paint im not 100 sure its even a good way to paint but it seemed a good enough bet to be worth trying our teacher professor ulivi was a nice guy he could see i worked hard and gave me a good grade which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had but the accademia wasnt teaching me anything except italian and my money was running out so at the end of the first year i went back to the us i wanted to go back to risd but i was now broke and risd was very expensive so i decided to get a job for a year and then return to risd the next fall i got one at a company called interleaf which made software for creating documents you mean like microsoft word exactly that was how i learned that low end software tends to eat high end software but interleaf still had a few years to live yet 5 interleaf had done something pretty bold inspired by emacs theyd added a scripting language and even made the scripting language a dialect of lisp now they wanted a lisp hacker to write things in it this was the closest thing ive had to a normal job and i hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers because i was a bad employee their lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant c cake and since i didnt know c and didnt want to learn it i never understood most of the software plus i was terribly irresponsible this was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours that seemed unnatural to me and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking but at the time it caused a lot of friction toward the end of the year i spent much of my time surreptitiously working on on lisp which i had by this time gotten a contract to publish the good part was that i got paid huge amounts of money especially by art student standards in florence after paying my part of the rent my budget for everything else had been 7 a day now i was getting paid more than 4 times that every hour even when i was just sitting in a meeting by living cheaply i not only managed to save enough to go back to risd but also paid off my college loans i learned some useful things at interleaf though they were mostly about what not to do

for technology companies to be run by product people than sales people though sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good at it that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people that cheap office space is no bargain if its depressing that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations that big bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money and that theres not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking or conventional offices and the optimal place for it but the most important thing i learned and which i used in both viaweb and y combinator is that the low end eats the high end that its good to be the entry level option even though that will be less prestigious because if youre not someone else will be and will squash you against the ceiling which in turn means that prestige is a danger sign when i left to go back to risd the next fall i arranged to do freelance work for the group that did projects for customers and this was how i survived for the next several years when i came back to visit for a project later on someone told me about a new thing called html which was as he described it a derivative of sgml markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at interleaf and i ignored him but this html thing later became a big part of my life in the fall of 1992 i moved back to providence to continue at risd the foundation had merely been intro stuff and the accademia had been a very civilized joke now i was going to see what real art school was like but alas it was more like the accademia than not better organized certainly and a lot more expensive but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine at least not the painting department the textile department which my next door neighbor belonged to seemed to be pretty rigorous no doubt illustration and architecture were too but painting was postrigorous painting students were supposed to express themselves which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style a signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business is known as a schtick something that immediately identifies the work as yours and no one elses for example when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon you know its by roy lichtenstein so if you see a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager you know he paid millions of dollars for it thats not always why

to be the best art school in the country to learn to draw even better they tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at risd but they kept going because painting was what they did i was

in show business is known as a schtick something that immediately identifies the work as yours and no one elses for example when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon you know its by roy lichtenstein so if you see a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager you know he paid millions of dollars for it thats not always why artists have a

kids who could draw in high school but at risd i was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers i learned a lot in the color class i took at risd but otherwise i was basically teaching myself to paint and i could do that for free so in 1993 i dropped out i hung around providence for a bit and then my college friend nancy parmet did me a big favor a rentcontrolled apartment in a building her mother owned in new york was becoming vacant did i want it it wasnt much more than my current place and new york was supposed to be where the artists were so yes i wanted it 7 asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of roman gaul that turns out not to be controlled by the romans you can do something similar on a map of new york city if you zoom in on the upper east side theres a tiny corner thats not rich or at least wasnt in 1993 its called yorkville and that was my new home now i was a new york artist in the strictly technical sense of making paintings and living in new york i was nervous about money because i could sense that interleaf was on the way down freelance lisp hacking work was very rare and i didnt want to have to program in another language which in those days would have meant c if i was lucky so with my unerring nose for financial opportunity i decided to write another book on lisp this would be a popular book the sort of book that could be used as a textbook i imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting the painting on the cover of this book ansi common lisp is one that i painted around this time the best thing about new york for me was the presence of idelle and julian weber idelle weber was a painter one of the early photorealists and id taken her painting class at harvard ive never known a teacher more beloved by her students large numbers of former students kept in touch with her including me after i moved to new york i became her de facto studio assistant she liked to paint on big square canvases 4 to 5 feet on a side one day in late 1994 as i was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager he wasnt that much older than me and was super rich the thought suddenly occurred to me why dont i become rich then ill be able to work on whatever i want meanwhile id been hearing more and more about this new thing called the world wide web robert morris showed it to me when i visited him in cambridge where he was now in grad school at harvard it seemed to me that the web would be a big deal id seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers it seemed like the web would do the same for the internet if i wanted to get rich here was the next train leaving the station i was right about that part what i got wrong was the idea i decided we should start a company to put art galleries online i cant honestly say after reading so many y combinator applications that', 'ases

wrong was the idea i decided we should start a company to put art galleries online i cant honestly say after reading so many y combinator applications that this was the worst startup idea ever but it was up there art galleries didnt want to be online and still dont not the fancy ones thats not how they sell i wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries and robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages then we tried to sign up galleries to call this a difficult sale would be an understatement it was difficult to give away a few galleries let us make sites for them for free but none paid us then some online stores started to appear and i realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites wed been generating for galleries this impressivesounding thing called an internet storefront was something we already knew how to build so in the summer of 1995 after i submitted the cameraready copy of ansi common lisp to the publishers we started trying to write software to build online stores at first this was going to be normal desktop software which in those days meant windows software that was an alarming prospect because neither of us knew how to write windows software or wanted to learn we lived in the unix world but we decided wed at least try writing a prototype store builder on unix robert wrote a shopping cart and i wrote a new site generator for stores in lisp of course we were working out of roberts apartment in cambridge his roommate was away for big chunks of time during which i got to sleep in his room for some reason there was no bed frame or sheets just a mattress on the floor one morning as i was lying on this mattress i had an idea that made me sit up like a capital l what if we ran the software on the server and let users control it by clicking on links then wed never have to write anything to run on users computers we could generate the sites on the same server wed serve them from users wouldnt need anything more than a browser this kind of software known as a web app is common now but at the time it wasnt clear that it was even possible to find out we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser a couple days later on august 12 we had one that worked the ui was horrible but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server now we felt like we were really onto something i had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way you wouldnt need versions or ports or any of that crap at interleaf there had been a whole group called release engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software now you could just update the software right on the server we started a new company we called viaweb after the fact that our software worked via the web and we got 10000 in seed funding from idelles husband julian in return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice we gave him 10 of the company ten years later this deal became the model for

became the model for y combinators we knew founders needed something like this because wed needed it ourselves at this stage i had a negative net worth because the thousand dollars or so i had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by what i owed the government in taxes had i diligently set aside the proper proportion of the money id made consulting for interleaf no i had not so although robert had his graduate student stipend i needed that seed funding to live on we originally hoped to launch in september but we got more ambitious about the software as we worked on it eventually we managed to build a wysiwyg site builder in the sense that as you were creating pages they looked exactly like the static ones that would be generated later except that instead of leading to static pages the links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the server it helped to have studied art because the main goal of an online store builder is to make users look legit and the key to looking legit is high production values if you get page layouts and fonts and colors right you can make a guy running a store out of his bedroom look more legit than a big company if youre curious why my site looks so oldfashioned its because its still made with this software it may look clunky today but in 1996 it was the last word in slick in september robert rebelled weve been working on this for a month he said and its still not done this is funny in retrospect because he would still be working on it almost 3 years later but i decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers and i asked robert who else in grad school with him was really good he recommended trevor blackwell which surprised me at first because at that point i knew trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything in his life to a stack of notecards which he carried around with him but rtm was right as usual trevor turned out to be a frighteningly effective hacker it was a lot of fun working with robert and trevor theyre the two most independentminded people i know and in completely different ways if you could see inside rtms brain it would look like a colonial new england church and if you could see inside trevors it would look like the worst excesses of austrian rococo we opened for business with 6 stores in january 1996 it was just as well we waited a few months because although we worried we were

software the next 3 years would have been the easiest of my life unfortunately i had to do a lot more all of it stuff i was worse at than programming and the next 3 years were instead the most stressful there were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s we were determined to be the microsoft word not the interleaf which meant being easy to use and inexpensive it was lucky for us that we were poor because that caused us to make viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized we charged 100 a month for a small store and 300 a month for a big one this low price was a big attraction and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors but it wasnt because of some clever insight that we set the price low we had no idea what businesses paid for things 300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us we did a lot of things right by accident like that for example we did whats now called doing things that dont scale although at the time we would have described it as being so lame that were driven to the most desperate measures to get users the most common of which was building stores for them this seemed particularly humiliating since the whole raison detre of our software was that people could use it to make their own stores but anything to get users we learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know for example that if you could only have a small image of a mans shirt and all images were small then by present standards it was better to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt the reason i remember learning this was that it meant i had to rescan about 30 images of mens shirts my first set of scans were so beautiful too though this felt wrong it was exactly the right thing to be doing building stores for users taught us about retail and about how it felt to use our software i was initially both mystified and repelled by business and thought we needed a business person to be in charge of it but once we started to get users i was converted in much the same way i was converted to fatherhood once i had kids whatever users wanted i was all theirs maybe one day wed have so many users that i couldnt scan their images for them but in the meantime there was nothing more important to do another thing i didnt get at the time is that growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup our growth rate was fine we had about 70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997 i mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number of users and that is the thing that matters in the sense that thats how much money youre making and if youre not making enough you might go out of business but in the long term the growth rate takes care of the absolute number if wed

alas i hired lots more people partly because our investors wanted me to and partly because thats what startups did during the internet bubble a company with just a handful of employees would have seemed amateurish so we didnt reach breakeven until about when yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998 which in turn meant we were at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company and since both we and our investors were noobs at startups the result was a mess even by startup standards it was a huge relief when yahoo bought us in principle our viaweb stock was valuable it was a share in a business that was profitable and growing rapidly but it didnt feel very valuable to me i had no idea how to value a business but i was all too keenly aware of the neardeath experiences we seemed to have every few months nor had i changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we started so when yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to riches since we were going to california i bought a car a yellow 1998 vw gti i remember thinking that its leather seats alone were by far the most luxurious thing i owned the next year from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999 must have been the least productive of my life i didnt realize it at the time but i was worn out from the effort and stress of running viaweb for a while after i got to california i tried to continue my usual mo of programming till 3 in the morning but fatigue combined with yahoos prematurely aged culture and grim cube farm in santa clara gradually dragged me down after a few months it felt disconcertingly like working at interleaf yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us at the time i thought yahoo was so overvalued that theyd never be worth anything but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next year i hung on till the first chunk of options vested then in the summer of 1999 i left it had been so long since id painted anything that id half forgotten why i was doing this my brain had been entirely full of software and mens shirts for 4 years but i had done this to get rich so i could paint i reminded myself and now i was rich so i should go paint when i said i was leaving my boss at yahoo had a long conversation with me about my plans i told him all about the kinds of pictures i wanted to paint at the time i was touched that he took such an interest in me now i realize it was because he thought i was lying my options at that point were worth about 2 million a month if i was leaving that kind of money on the table it could only be to go and start some new startup and if i did i might take people with me this was the height of the internet bubble and yahoo was ground zero of it my boss was at that', ' i hung on till the first chunk of options vested

but i really was quitting to paint and i started immediately there was no time to lose id already burned 4 years getting rich now when i talk to founders who are leaving after selling their companies my advice is always the same take a vacation thats what i should have done just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two but the idea never occurred to me so i tried to paint but i just didnt seem to have any energy or ambition part of the problem was that i didnt know many people in california id compounded this problem by buying a house up in the santa cruz mountains with a beautiful view but miles from anywhere i stuck it out for a few more months then in desperation i went back to new york where unless you understand about rent control youll be surprised to hear i still had my apartment sealed up like a tomb of my old life idelle was in new york at least and there were other people trying to paint there even though i didnt know any of them when i got back to new york i resumed my old life except now i was rich it was as weird as it sounds i resumed all my old patterns except now there were doors where there hadnt been now when i was tired of walking all i had to do was raise my hand and unless it was raining a taxi would stop to pick me up now when i walked past charming little restaurants i could go in and order lunch it was exciting for a while painting started to go better i experimented with a new kind of still life where id paint one painting in the old way then photograph it and print it blown up on canvas and then use that as the underpainting for a second still life painted from the same objects which hopefully hadnt rotted yet meanwhile i looked for an apartment to buy now i could actually choose what neighborhood to live in

so while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea he firmly refused to work on it hmph well id do it myself then i recruited dan giffin who had worked for viaweb and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs and we got to work trying to build what its now clear is about twenty companies and several open source projects worth of software the language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of lisp but i wasnt so naive as to assume i could spring an overt lisp on a general audience wed hide the parentheses like dylan did by then there was a name for the kind of company viaweb was an application service provider or asp this name didnt last long before it was replaced by software as a service but it was current for long enough that i named this new company after it it was going to be called aspra i started working on the application builder dan worked on network infrastructure and the two undergrads worked on the first two services images and phone calls but about halfway through the summer i realized i really didnt want to run a company especially not a big one which it was looking like this would have to be id only started viaweb because i needed the money now that i didnt need money anymore why was i doing this if this vision had to be realized as a company then screw the vision id build a subset that could be done as an open source project much to my surprise the time i spent working on this stuff was not wasted after all after we started y combinator i would often encounter startups working on parts of this new architecture and it was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and even trying to write some of it the subset i would build as an open source project was the new lisp whose parentheses i now wouldnt even have to hide a

editors the only way to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published as a book or in a newspaper or magazine now anyone could publish anything this had been possible in principle since 1993 but not many people had realized it yet i had been intimately involved with building the infrastructure of the web for most of that time and a writer as well and it had taken me 8 years to realize it even then it took me several years to understand the implications it meant there would be a whole new generation of essays 11 in the print era the channel for publishing essays had been vanishingly small except for a few officially anointed thinkers who went to the right parties in new york the only people allowed to publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties there were so many essays that had never been written because there had been no way to publish them now they could be and i was going to write them 12 ive worked on several different things but to the extent there was a turning point where i figured out what to work on it was when i started publishing essays online from then on i knew that whatever else i did id always write essays too i knew that online essays would be a marginal medium at first socially theyd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their geocities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions published in the new yorker but by this point i knew enough to find that encouraging instead of discouraging one of the most conspicuous patterns ive noticed in my life is how well it has worked for me at least to work on things that werent prestigious still life has always been the least prestigious form of painting viaweb and y combinator both seemed lame when we started them i still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what im writing and i explain that its an essay im going to publish on my web site even lisp though prestigious intellectually in something like the way latin is also seems about as hip its not that unprestigious types of work are good per se but when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack of prestige its a sign both that theres something real to be discovered there and that you have the right kind of motives impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious if anything is going to lead you astray it will be the desire to impress people so while working on things that arent prestigious doesnt guarantee youre on the right track it at least guarantees youre not on the most common type of wrong one over the next several years i wrote lots of essays about all kinds of different topics oreilly reprinted a collection of them as a book called hackers painters after one of the essays in it i also worked on spam filters and did

diners three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one party so for every guest two thirds of the other guests would be people they didnt know but would probably like one of the guests was someone i didnt know but would turn out to like a lot a woman called jessica livingston a couple days later i asked her out jessica was in charge of marketing at a boston investment bank this bank thought it understood startups but over the next year as she met friends of mine from the startup world she was surprised how different reality was and how colorful their stories were so she decided to compile a book of interviews with startup founders when the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her staff she started looking for a new job in early 2005 she interviewed for a marketing job at a boston vc firm it took them weeks to make up their minds and during this time i started telling her about all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital they should make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a handful of giant ones they should be funding younger more technical founders instead of mbas they should let the founders remain as ceo and so on one of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks the prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people and tell them something that wont waste their time is a great spur to the imagination when the harvard computer society the undergrad computer club asked me to give a talk i decided i would tell them how to start a startup maybe theyd be able to avoid the worst of the mistakes wed made so i gave this talk in the course of which i told them that the best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders because then theyd be sources of advice too whereupon it seemed they were all looking expectantly at me horrified at the prospect of having my inbox flooded by business plans if id only known i blurted out but not me and went on with the talk

again ignorance worked in our favor we had no idea how to be angel investors and in boston in 2005 there were no ron conways to learn from so we just made what seemed like the obvious choices and some of the things we did turned out to be novel there are multiple components to y combinator and we didnt figure them all out at once the part we got first was to be an angel firm in those days those two words didnt go together there were vc firms which were organized companies with people whose job it was to make investments but they only did big million dollar investments and there were angels who did smaller investments but these were individuals who were usually focused on other things and made investments on the side and neither of them helped founders enough in the beginning we knew how helpless founders were in some respects because we remembered how helpless wed been for example one thing julian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us set up as a company we were fine writing fairly difficult software but actually getting incorporated with bylaws and stock and all that stuff how on earth did you do that our plan was not only to make seed investments but to do for startups everything julian had done for us yc was not organized as a fund it was cheap enough to run that we funded it with our own money that went right by 99 of readers but professional investors are thinking wow that means they got all the returns but once again this was not due to any particular insight on our part we didnt know how vc firms were organized it never occurred to us to try to raise a fund and if it had we wouldnt have known where to start 14 the most distinctive thing about yc is the batch model to fund a bunch of startups all at once twice a year and then to spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them that part we discovered by accident not merely implicitly but explicitly due to our ignorance about investing we needed to get experience as investors what better way we thought than to fund a whole bunch of startups at once we knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech companies during the summer why not organize a summer program where theyd start startups instead we wouldnt feel guilty for being in a sense fake investors because they would in a similar sense be fake founders so while we probably wouldnt make much money out of it wed at least get to practice being investors on them and they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer than they would working at microsoft wed use the building i owned in cambridge as our headquarters wed all have dinner there once a week on tuesdays since i was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays and after dinner wed bring in experts on startups to give talks we knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the summer founders program and i posted an announcement on my site inviting undergrads to apply i had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get deal flow as investors call it but it turned', ' once we knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech companies during

posted an announcement on my site inviting undergrads to apply i had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get deal flow as investors call it but it turned out to be the perfect source 15 we got 225 applications for the summer founders program and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people whod already graduated or were about to that spring already this sfp thing was starting to feel more serious than wed intended we invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person and from those we picked 8 to fund they were an impressive group that first batch included reddit justin kan and emmett shear who went on to found twitch aaron swartz who had already helped write the rss spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access and sam altman who would later become the second president of yc i dont think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good you had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the summer founders program instead of a summer job at a legit place like microsoft or goldman sachs the deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with julian 10k for 10 and what robert said mit grad students got for the summer 6k we invested 6k per founder which in the typical twofounder case was 12k in return for 6 that had to be fair because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken plus that first summer which was really hot jessica brought the founders free air conditioners 16 fairly quickly i realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding funding startups in batches was more convenient for us because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once but being part of a batch was better for the startups too it solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders the isolation now you not only had colleagues but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them as yc grew we started to notice other advantages of scale the alumni became a tight community dedicated to helping one another and especially the current batch whose shoes they remembered being in we also noticed that the startups were becoming one anothers customers we used to refer jokingly to the yc gdp but as yc grows this becomes less and less of a joke now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates i had not originally intended yc to be a fulltime job i was going to do three things hack write essays and work on yc as yc grew and i grew more excited about it it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention but for the first few years i was still able to work on other things in the summer of 2006 robert and i started working on a new version of arc this one was reasonably fast because it was compiled into scheme to test this new arc i wrote hacker news in it it was originally meant to be a news aggregator for

so i changed the name to hacker news and the topic to whatever engaged ones intellectual curiosity hn was no doubt good for yc but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me if all id had to do was select and help founders life would have been so easy and that implies that hn was a mistake surely the biggest source of stress in ones work should at least be something close to the core of the work whereas i was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running but because i had a blister from an illfitting shoe when i was dealing with some urgent problem during yc there was about a 60 chance it had to do with hn and a 40 chance it had do with everything else combined 17 as well as hn i wrote all of ycs internal software in arc but while i continued to work a good deal in arc i gradually stopped working on arc partly because i didnt have time to and partly because it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language now that we had all this infrastructure depending on it so now my three projects were reduced to two writing essays and working on yc yc was different from other kinds of work ive done instead of deciding for myself what to work on the problems came to me every 6 months there was a new batch of startups and their problems whatever they were became our problems it was very engaging work because their problems were quite varied and the good founders were very effective if you were trying to learn the most you could about startups in the shortest possible time you couldnt have picked a better way to do it there were parts of the job i didnt like disputes between cofounders figuring out when people were lying to us fighting with people who maltreated the startups and so on but i worked hard even

attention it had already eaten arc and was in the process of eating essays too either yc was my lifes work or id have to leave eventually and it wasnt so i would in the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer the stroke destroyed her balance and she was put in a nursing home but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house and my sister and i were determined to help her do it i used to fly up to oregon to visit her regularly and i had a lot of time to think on those flights on one of them i realized i was ready to hand yc over to someone else i asked jessica if she wanted to be president but she didnt so we decided wed try to recruit sam altman we talked to robert and trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard up till that point yc had been controlled by the original llc we four had started but we wanted yc to last for a long time and to do that it couldnt be controlled by the founders so if sam said yes wed let him reorganize yc robert and i would retire and jessica and trevor would become ordinary partners when we asked sam if he wanted to be president of yc initially he said no he wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors but i kept at it and in october 2013 he finally agreed we decided hed take over starting with the winter 2014 batch for the rest of 2013 i left running yc more and more to sam partly so he could learn the job and partly because i was focused on my mother whose cancer had returned she died on january 15 2014 we knew this was coming but it was still hard when it did i kept working on yc till march to help get that batch of startups through demo day then i checked out pretty completely i still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things im interested in but that only takes a few hours a week what should i do next rtms advice hadnt included anything about that i wanted to do something completely different so i decided id paint i wanted to see how good i could get if i really focused on it so the day after i stopped working on yc i started painting i was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape but it was at least completely engaging 18 i spent most of the rest of 2014 painting id never been able to work so uninterruptedly before and i got to be better than i had been not good enough but better then in november right in the middle of a painting i ran out of steam up till that point id always been curious to see how the painting i was working on would turn out but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a

      "ases 4 to 5 feet on a side one day in late 1994 as i was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager he wasnt that much older than me and was super rich the thought suddenly occurred to me why dont i become rich then ill be able to work on whatever i want meanwhile id been hearing more and more about this new thing called the world wide web robert morris showed it to me when i visited him in cambridge where he was now in grad school at harvard it seemed to me that the web would be a big deal id seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers it seemed like the web would do the same for the internet if i wanted to get rich here was the next train leaving the station i was right about that part what i got wrong was the idea i decided we should start a company to put art galleries online i cant honestly say after reading so many y combinator applications that this was the worst startup idea ever but it was up there art galleries didnt want to be online and still dont not the fancy ones thats not how they sell i wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries and robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages then we tried to sign up galleries to call this a difficult sale would be an understatement it was difficult to give away a few galleries let us make sites for them for free but none paid us then some online stores started to appear and i realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites wed been generating for galleries this impressivesounding thing called an internet storefront was something we already knew how to build so in the summer of 1995 after i submitted the cameraready copy of ansi common lisp to the publishers we started trying to write software to build online stores at first this was going to be normal desktop software which in those days meant windows software that was an alarming prospect because neither of us knew how to write windows software or wanted to learn we lived in the unix world but we decided wed at least try writing a prototype store builder on unix robert wrote a shopping cart and i wrote a new site generator for stores in lisp of course we were working out of roberts apartment in cambridge his roommate was away for big chunks of time during which i got to sleep in his room for some reason there was no bed frame or sheets just a mattress on the floor one morning as i was lying on this mattress i had an idea that made me sit up like a capital l what if we ran the software on the server and let users control it by clicking on links then wed never have to write anything to run on users computers we could generate the sites on the same server wed serve them from users wouldnt need anything more than a browser this kind of software known as a web app is common now but at the time it wasnt clear that it was even possible to find out we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser a couple days later on august 12 we had one that worked the ui was horrible but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server now we felt like we were really onto something i had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way you wouldnt need versions or ports or any of that crap at interleaf there had been a whole group called release engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software now you could just update the software right on the server we started a new company we called viaweb after the fact that our software worked via the web and we got 10000 in seed funding from idelles husband julian in return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice we gave him 10 of the company ten years later this deal became the model for y\n",

      "minded people i know and in completely different ways if you could see inside rtms brain it would look like a colonial new england church and if you could see inside trevors it would look like the worst excesses of austrian rococo we opened for business with 6 stores in january 1996 it was just as well we waited a few months because although we worried we were late we were actually almost fatally early there was a lot of talk in the press then about ecommerce but not many people actually wanted online stores 8 there were three main parts to the software the editor which people used to build sites and which i wrote the shopping cart which robert wrote and the manager which kept track of orders and statistics and which trevor wrote in its time the editor was one of the best generalpurpose site builders i kept the code tight and didnt have to integrate with any other software except roberts and trevors so it was quite fun to work on if all id had to do was work on this software the next 3 years would have been the easiest of my life unfortunately i had to do a lot more all of it stuff i was worse at than programming and the next 3 years were instead the most stressful there were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s we were determined to be the microsoft word not the interleaf which meant being easy to use and inexpensive it was lucky for us that we were poor because that caused us to make viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized we charged 100 a month for a small store and 300 a month for a big one this low price was a big attraction and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors but it wasnt because of some clever insight that we set the price low we had no idea what businesses paid for things 300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us we did a lot of things right by accident like that for example we did whats now called doing things that dont scale although at the time we would have described it as being so lame that were driven to the most desperate measures to get users the most common of which was building stores for them this seemed particularly humiliating since the whole raison detre of our software was that people could use it to make their own stores but anything to get users we learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know for example that if you could only have a small image of a mans shirt and all images were small then by present standards it was better to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt the reason i remember learning this was that it meant i had to rescan about 30 images of mens shirts my first set of scans were so beautiful too though this felt wrong it was exactly the right thing to be doing building stores for users taught us about retail and about how it felt to use our software i was initially both mystified and repelled by business and thought we needed a business person to be in charge of it but once we started to get users i was converted in much the same way i was converted to fatherhood once i had kids whatever users wanted i was all theirs maybe one day wed have so many users that i couldnt scan their images for them but in the meantime there was nothing more important to do another thing i didnt get at the time is that growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup our growth rate was fine we had about 70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997 i mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number of users and that is the thing that matters in the sense that thats how much money youre making and if youre not making enough you might go out of business but in the long term the growth rate takes care of the absolute number if wed been a startup i was advising at y combinator i would have said stop being so stressed out because youre doing fine youre growing 7x a\n",
